# nixos-config

### New Machine Bringup

Once you've got NixOS booting to a default config generated by `nixos-generate-config`, make sure you've got `home-manager` added as a channel (only for the root user, so the the `sudo` is important here)

```
$ sudo nix-channel --add https://github.com/rycee/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
$ sudo nix-channel --update
```

After this you should see something like

```
$ sudo nix-channel --list
home-manager https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/release-22.11.tar.gz
nixos https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-22.11
```

Then clone down this repo, make a new `configuration.nix` for the new machine which imports the `base-configuration.nix` and the locally generated `hardware-configuration.nix`, then symlink that new `configuration.nix` from the source tree of this repo to the `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` path and rebuild boot

```
sudo nixos-rebuild boot
reboot
```

TODO
- [ ] `home-manager`'s `services.screen-locker` seems useful for autolocking
- [ ] vscode config tracked in home-manager
- [x] i3 config tracked in home-manager
- [ ] setup some nix eval CI for this repo
- [ ] rofi power menu setup
- [ ] polybar/i3bar configuration
- [ ] i3 managed with home-manager
- [ ] provide an overlay or some other way of synthesizing work and home from a base config

Explore the current configuration with the repl, you'll be abel to access the `config` attrset after this path is loaded

```
nix repl>:l <nixpkgs/nixos>
```

And similarly, against the configuration of your current system via `nix-instantiate`:

```bash
nix-instantiate --eval -E '(import <nixpkgs/nixos> {}).config.nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree'
```

Notes on spotifyd and spt

- trying to authenticate with the 1password CLI `op`
- eval $(op signin) - what does this do to my environment?

To get this working manually outside of systemd, all in the same terminal

```
eval $(op signin)

# to keep this thing from detaching, `--no-daemon`
spotify --no-deamon --config-path /nix/store/...

# where I stole the nix store path for the config file from
systemctl status --user spotifyd which is provided by my nixos config
```

Then in a new terminal we can open the spotify TUI

```
spt
# proceed to jam out
```
